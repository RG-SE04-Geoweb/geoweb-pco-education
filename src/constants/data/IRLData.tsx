    wtfIsIt: "An AR metaverse layer over the real world, anchoring digital content and using special browsers based on geo location. Each land parcel is administered using partial common ownership.",
    whyDoesThisMatter: "As augmented and virtual reality become the next dominant computing platforms, we need new, open and decentralized protocols that out-compete proprietary and centralized alternatives.

    whyDoesThisMatter: "This proposal represented unique thinking on how to fairly price and distribute ENS domains. Domain names are often instruments of extreme investment efficiency and oftentimes financial weaponization. This proposal aimed to alleviate this pressure.",
